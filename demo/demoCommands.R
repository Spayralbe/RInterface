#If the dimensions of the expression_data table are large, you may want to create a subset of the data first: 
#e.g. select only the columns and rows for which at least one intensity value > 10
# note: if you do not make a subset when the table is very large, it may take a while to produce the heatmap; 
#       clustering will take a lot of time then
#To make a subset, uncomment the lines below:
#dm1<-apply((expression_data), MARGIN=1, max,na.rm=T)
#dm2<-apply((expression_data), MARGIN=2, max,na.rm=T)
# r1<-which(dm1>10)
# c1<-which(dm2>10)
#length(r1)
#length(c1)
#subset<-expression_data[r1,c1]
